# Bootcamp Project 2

This project was designed to showcase usage of Flask, the leaflet.js library of Javascript, and unifying the above in an HTML environment.
The subject chosen for the project was the distribution of AirBnB listings in New York City; I handled the creation of the bubble chart overlay for displaying which boroughs of NYC had the most or fewest listings and which particular sections within boroughs had said listings.
